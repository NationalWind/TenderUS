# This is for testing the functionality of the server's sms verification. The code might be reused in the future's client code. Waiting for the official android folder...

# To use
This is implemented to run on a real android device and can be tested by connecting to your android device thru wifi in developer mode.
The client and server in this test are connected thru a wlan. Need to allocate the server an ip address (static one recommended).

## Change in the code
Change the phoneNumber variable, change the server ip address for the client to connect to.
